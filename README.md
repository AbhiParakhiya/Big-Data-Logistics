# 📦 Big Data Analytics in Logistics

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project focuses on **Big Data and Cloud Computing in Logistics**, where we analyze large-scale delivery and routing data using **PySpark** for fast processing and provide **interactive visualizations**. The objective is to extract actionable insights that can help optimize delivery operations, agent performance, and route efficiency.

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- Read and process large logistics datasets using **Apache Spark**.
- Perform **descriptive** and **advanced analytics** on delivery performance.
- Generate **interactive visualizations** using tools like **Plotly**, **Matplotlib**, or **Seaborn**.
- Include **prediction models** to estimate delivery times.
- Support for **Cloud storage** integration (e.g., AWS S3, GCP).

## 🔍 Example Analytics Queries

### 🧩 Basic Queries
1. Show top 5 rows of the dataset.
2. Count total orders.
3. Count distinct delivery agents.
4. Average delivery time.
5. Distribution of orders per vehicle type.
6. Orders per weather condition.
7. Orders per traffic condition.
8. Orders per area.
9. Daily order volume trend.
10. Count of late deliveries (`Delivery_Time` > threshold).

### 🚀 Advanced Queries
1. Average delivery time per category.
2. Correlation between `Agent_Rating` and `Delivery_Time`.
3. Top performing areas (fastest delivery).
4. Predict delivery time using ML (Linear Regression).
5. Cluster delivery routes using KMeans (optional).
